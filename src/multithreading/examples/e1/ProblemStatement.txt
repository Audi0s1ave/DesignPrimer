Design a class, which contains two methods, schedule() and waitUntilComplete(), when user wanna execute a work, will call schedule()
 (schedule() method will returns immediately),
The function of waitUntilComplete is to wait for all the existing work to be executed, and then return. Because is multi-thread, need to consider thread safe.
